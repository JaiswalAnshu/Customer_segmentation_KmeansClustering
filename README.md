# 🚀 K-Means Clustering for Customer Segmentation

## 📌 Overview
**Customer segmentation** is a powerful technique used in marketing and business strategy to identify distinct groups of customers based on their purchasing behavior, demographics, or preferences.
In this project, I have implemented K-Means Clustering , an unsupervised machine learning algorithm, to segment customers into meaningful groups. 

This analysis would go through the Customer base and divides it into clusters enabling personalized marketing, improved customer engagement, and strategic decision-making to enahance Brand Awareness , Price Optimization , Enhancing Competitiveness , Acquisition and Retention ultimately increasing revenue nd ROI .  


## 🔍 Problem Statement
Businesses interact with a diverse range of customers. However, one-size-fits-all marketing strategies often fail to engage all customer types effectively.

💡 Goal: To group similar customers together based on their behaviors and attributes, allowing businesses to:
✅ Personalize marketing campaigns
✅ Improve customer engagement
✅ Increase revenue by targeting the right audience


## 📊 Dataset
The dataset consists of customer information such as:

- CustomerID
- Gender
- Age
- Annual Income (k$)
- Spending Score (1-100)
  
The features are used to group customers into distinct clusters are : Annual Income (k$) and Spending Score (1-100) .


## 🔧 Tech Stack & Tools
🛠 Libraries Used:

- Pandas → Data manipulation
- NumPy → Mathematical operations
- Matplotlib & Seaborn → Data visualization
- Scikit-Learn → K-Means Clustering


## 📈 Methodology
1️⃣ Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for clustering.
2️⃣ Finding the Optimal Clusters: Used the Elbow Method to determine the best number of clusters.
3️⃣ Applying K-Means Clustering: Implemented K-Means to segment customers.
4️⃣ Visualization: Plotted the clusters for better understanding.


## 📌 Key Insights
📊 Elbow Method: Identified the optimal number of clusters using the WCSS (Within-Cluster Sum of Squares).
📌 Cluster Formation: Customers were segmented into 5 groups based on their spending habits and income levels.
📢 Business Impact: Helps businesses make informed decisions about personalized marketing and customer retention strategies.
